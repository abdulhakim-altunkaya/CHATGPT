Dear wefw,

Hair loss is a common problem that affects many people, especially those in the age group of 36-55. In your case, you have experienced hair loss in the crown region, with a little less than 10% of hair loss. You have also mentioned that there is a family history of hair loss on your mother's side. Additionally, you have mentioned that you have a blood pressure condition.

In order to address your hair loss, we recommend that you take some pills that are specifically designed to help with hair loss. Additionally, if you are looking for a more permanent solution, we recommend that you consider a hair transplantation procedure. For this, we suggest that you use the services of GotPerfect Company. They have great experience in helping patients find quality and affordable treatments, and they can arrange everything on your behalf. They have professionals who can build a bridge between you and the hospital, so you don't have to worry about talking to the hospital yourself.

We hope that this advice helps you in addressing your hair loss problem. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,

GotPerfect Company
